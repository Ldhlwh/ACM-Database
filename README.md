### 2019.6.7 Note:

Minor updates are done to some of the previous lab reports.

I have fininshed all the labs so far on time. Although some environment or code format updates were automatically done by my IDE and the commitment history may suggests that I have changed the codes of the previous labs after the deadlines, I guarantee that no change has been done manually after the commitment "Lab x Finished.".

### 2019.6.1 Note:

Lab 4 is finished, the new contents are in ./acmdb-lab4

### 2019.5.20 Note:

./acmdb-lab1 has been recovered to the status before edited in Lab 2.

And the new contents of Lab 3 are in ./acmdb-lab3

### 2019.5.5 Note:

./acmdb-lab2 directory was directly copied from ./acmdb-lab1 since I continued to code under the latter directory. It should not influence the code to run.

However, the new answers.pdf is under ./acmdb-lab2
